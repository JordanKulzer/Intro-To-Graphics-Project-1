# HW1
I used Visual Studios 2019 on Windows. 
The renderPixel lights up the pixels using an the if/else statement that depends on the size of the radius. 
Then in the rasterizeArc function, i used the renderPixel function to center it around the 150, so that 0 wasn't the origin.  Then used the midpoint function to rasterize each arc.
The only change I made in the main was that I called rasterizeArc twice, with each radius in the function call.
